- 👋 Hi, I’m @Koukotsukan
- 👀 I’m interested in taking ten times as long to make my life a little little bit easier.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning AI (NLP, Game Programming, Machine Learning, Deep Learning)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on fighting COVID-19 post-trauma with all humans.
- 📫 How to reach me? By tying a letter to the leg of a carrier pigeon.
